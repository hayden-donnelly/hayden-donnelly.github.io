            <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Feather Engine is a lightweight 2D game engine.
                <br><br> Before I started working on this I was frustrated by the selection of existing game engines. Some of them produced bloated game builds, some had clunky interfaces or only supported scripting languages I didn't want use, and some just didn't have the underlying structure that I was looking for. So I had two options, I could settle for a less than ideal engine, or I could build my own idyllic engine from scratch. I chose the latter, and thus, Feather Engine was born. The engine has been re-written about four times now and is still an ongoing project, I'm currently working towards its first release.</div>
