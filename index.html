        <p>
            We were somewhere around the Planck scale<br>When the uncertainty principle began to take hold<br>I remember saying something like<br>"I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive..."<br>And suddenly there was a terrible roar<br>And the
            sky was full of what looked like huge electrons<br>All swooping and screeching and diving around the car<br>Which was going about the speed of light with the top down<br>
